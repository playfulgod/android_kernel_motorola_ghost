* MSM8960 ASoC Machine driver

Required properties:
- compatible : "qcom,msm8960-soc-audio"

Optional properties:
- qcom,msm8960-card-longname :
    This property will be used to fill in the long_name of the standard
    snd_soc_card structures.  It is visible in the /proc/asound/cards entry
    for user space to identify specific codecs available to it
- gpios-pri-i2s :
    This GPIO list is used to request the necessary GPIOs for the Primary I2S
    TX Path.  It should consist of the neccessary GPIOs to be requested and
    placed in their active configuration.  The necessary GPIOs can vary based
    on the device.
- gpios-pri-i2s-names :
    This is a required property if gpios-pri-i2s is provided above.  It must
    provide the corresponding GPIO labels to match with the above defined
    GPIOs.
- gpios-mi2s :
    This GPIO list is used to request the necessary GPIOs for the MI2S Path. It
    should consist of the necessary GPIOs to be requested and placed in their
    active configuration.  The necessary GPIOs can vary based on the device.
- gpios-mi2s-names :
    This is a required property if gpios-mi2s is provided above.  It must
    provide the corresponding GPIO labels to match with the above defined GPIOS

Optional Children:

* DAI Links:

Required properties:
- compatible :
    "qcom,msm8960-dai-link"
- qcom,msm8960-codec-name :
    codec name to match in dynamic DAI link table that can differ from device
    to device.  This string needs to match the 'codec_dai_name' field in order
    for the link to be initialized.

Example:

sound {
	status = "okay";
	compatible = "qcom,msm8960-soc-audio";

	qcom,msm8960-card-longname = "msm8960-snd-card-wcd,tfa9890_codec";

	/* Primary I2S TX */
	gpios-pri-i2s = <&msmgpio 55 0>, /* SCK */
			<&msmgpio 56 0>, /* WS */
			<&msmgpio 57 0>; /* DIN */
	gpios-pri-i2s-names = "pri-i2s-sck",
			      "pri-i2s-ws",
			      "pri-i2s-din";

	/* MI2S */
	gpios-mi2s = <&msmgpio 47 0>, /* WS   */
		     <&msmgpio 48 0>, /* SCK  */
		     <&msmgpio 49 0>, /* DIN  */
		     <&msmgpio 50 0>, /* DOUT */
		     <&msmgpio 53 0>; /* MCLK */
	gpios-mi2s-names = "mi2s_ws",
			  "mi2s_sck",
			  "mi2s_din",
			  "mi2s_dout",
			  "mi2s_mclk";

	/* DAI Links */
	dai-msm-stub-tx {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8960-dai-link";
		qcom,msm8960-codec-name = "msm-stub-tx";
	};

	dai-tfa9890 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8960-dai-link";
		qcom,msm8960-codec-name = "tfa9890_codec";
	};
};

* MSM DAI Q6 MI2S

Required properties:
- compatible :
    "qcom,msm-dai-q6-mi2s"
- qcom,msm-mi2s-rx-lines :
    This property describes the SD lines allocated to RX on the MI2S interface.
    This should be expressed as a bitmask and should not overlap those
    allocated in the TX definition.  The masks are defined with the following:
        MSM_MI2S_SD0    1
        MSM_MI2S_SD1    2
        MSM_MI2S_SD2    4
        MSM_MI2S_SD3    8
- qcom,msm-mi2s-tx-lines :
    This property describes the SD lines allocated to TX on the MI2S interface.
    This should be expressed as a bitmask and should not overlap those
    allocated in the RX definition.  The masks are defined with the following:
        MSM_MI2S_SD0    1
        MSM_MI2S_SD1    2
        MSM_MI2S_SD2    4
        MSM_MI2S_SD3    8

Example:

qcom,msm-dai-q6-mi2s {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-dai-q6-mi2s";
	qcom,msm-mi2s-rx-lines = <4>; /* MSM_MI2S_SD2 */
};


* MSM DAI Q6

Required properties:
- compatible :
    "qcom,msm-dai-q6"
- qcom,msm-dai-q6-dev-id :
    This property determines which snd_soc_dai_driver the MSM audio driver will
    register with the sound framework. It will also be used to determine the
    device's name in the format of: msm-dai-q6.<dev_id>

Example:

qcom,msm-dai-q6 {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-dai-q6";
	qcom,msm-dai-q6-dev-id = <1>; /* PRIMARY_I2S_TX */
};
